🚀 Features

✅ Add Processes Dynamically
Enter process ID, arrival time, and burst time through an input form.

✅ Run FCFS Algorithm
Simulates CPU scheduling and computes:

Start time

Completion time

Waiting time

Turnaround time

✅ Visual Gantt Chart
Displays how each process executes over time in an interactive timeline.

✅ Performance Summary
Shows total processes, average waiting time, average turnaround time, and total completion time.

✅ Lightweight & Responsive
No backend or installation needed — runs entirely in your browser!
